API reference
Introduction
You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language, via our official Python bindings, our official Node.js library, or a community-maintained library.

To install the official Python bindings, run the following command:

pip install openai
To install the official Node.js library, run the following command in your Node.js project directory:

npm install openai@^4.0.0
Authentication
API keys
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. You can create API keys at a user or service account level. Service accounts are tied to a "bot" individual and should be used to provision access for production systems. Each API key can be scoped to one of the following,

Project keys - Provides access to a single project (preferred option); access Project API keys by selecting the specific project you wish to generate keys against.
User keys - Our legacy keys. Provides access to all organizations and all projects that user has been added to; access API Keys to view your available keys. We highly advise transitioning to project keys for best security practices, although access via this method is currently still supported.
Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:

Authorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY
Organizations and projects (optional)
For users who belong to multiple organizations or are accessing their projects through their legacy user API key, you can pass a header to specify which organization and project is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization and project.

To access the Default project in an organization, leave out the OpenAI-Project header

Example curl command:

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "OpenAI-Organization: YOUR_ORG_ID" \
  -H "OpenAI-Project: $PROJECT_ID"
Example with the openai Python package:

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  organization='YOUR_ORG_ID',
  project='$PROJECT_ID',
)
Example with the openai Node.js package:

import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
    organization: "YOUR_ORG_ID",
    project: "$PROJECT_ID",
});
Organization IDs can be found on your Organization settings page. Project IDs can be found on your General settings page by selecting the specific project.

Making requests
You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace $OPENAI_API_KEY with your secret API key. If you are using a legacy user key and you have multiple projects, you will also need to specify the Project Id. For improved security, we recommend transitioning to project based keys instead.

curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.7
   }'
This request queries the gpt-4o-mini model (which under the hood points to a gpt-4o-mini model variant) to complete the text starting with a prompt of "Say this is a test". You should get a response back that resembles the following:

{
    "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1677858242,
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 13,
        "completion_tokens": 7,
        "total_tokens": 20
    },
    "choices": [
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "\n\nThis is a test!"
            },
            "logprobs": null,
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "index": 0
        }
    ]
}
Now that you've generated your first chat completion, let's break down the response object. We can see the finish_reason is stop which means the API returned the full chat completion generated by the model without running into any limits. In the choices list, we only generated a single message but you can set the n parameter to generate multiple messages choices.

Streaming
The OpenAI API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the Server-sent events standard. Our official Node and Python libraries include helpers to make parsing these events simpler.

Streaming is supported for both the Chat Completions API and the Assistants API. This section focuses on how streaming works for Chat Completions. Learn more about how streaming works in the Assistants API here.

In Python, a streaming request looks like:

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test"}],
    stream=True,
)
for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
In Node / Typescript, a streaming request looks like:

import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function main() {
    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o-mini",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
        stream: true,
    });
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
    }
}

main();
Parsing Server-sent events
Parsing Server-sent events is non-trivial and should be done with caution. Simple strategies like splitting by a new line may result in parsing errors. We recommend using existing client libraries when possible.

Chat
Given a list of messages comprising a conversation, the model will return a response.

Related guide: Chat Completions

Create chat completion
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

Request body
messages
array

Required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Example Python code.


Show possible types
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. See the model endpoint compatibility table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

frequency_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

See more information about frequency and presence penalties.

logit_bias
map

Optional
Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

logprobs
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.

top_logprobs
integer or null

Optional
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

max_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.

The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. Example Python code for counting tokens.

n
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

presence_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

See more information about frequency and presence penalties.

response_format
object

Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show properties
seed
integer or null

Optional
This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service_tier
string or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:

If set to 'auto', the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
If set to 'default', the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.
When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.
When this parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier utilized.

stop
string / array / null

Optional
Defaults to null
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Example Python code.

stream_options
object or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

tools
array

Optional
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools are present.


Show possible types
parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

function_call
Deprecated
string or object

Optional
Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function.

none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.

AssistantsBeta
Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

Get started with the Assistants API

Create assistantBeta
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants
Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

Request body
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.

name
string or null

Optional
The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description
string or null

Optional
The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools
array

Optional
Defaults to []
A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types code_interpreter, file_search, or function.


Show possible types
tool_resources
object or null

Optional
A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the code_interpreter tool requires a list of file IDs, while the file_search tool requires a list of vector store IDs.


Show properties
metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.


Show possible types
Returns
An assistant object.

Related guide: Assistants

Create runBeta
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{thread_id}/runs
Create a run.

Path parameters
thread_id
string

Required
The ID of the thread to run.

Request body
assistant_id
string

Required
The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run.

model
string

Optional
The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

instructions
string or null

Optional
Overrides the instructions of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

additional_instructions
string or null

Optional
Appends additional instructions at the end of the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis without overriding other instructions.

additional_messages
array or null

Optional
Adds additional messages to the thread before creating the run.


Show properties
tools
array or null

Optional
Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
If true, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a data: [DONE] message.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status incomplete. See incomplete_details for more info.

truncation_strategy
object

Optional
Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

The run objectBeta
Represents an execution run on a thread.

id
string

The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints.

object
string

The object type, which is always thread.run.

created_at
integer

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was created.

thread_id
string

The ID of the thread that was executed on as a part of this run.

assistant_id
string

The ID of the assistant used for execution of this run.

status
string

The status of the run, which can be either queued, in_progress, requires_action, cancelling, cancelled, failed, completed, incomplete, or expired.

required_action
object or null

Details on the action required to continue the run. Will be null if no action is required.


Show properties
last_error
object or null

The last error associated with this run. Will be null if there are no errors.


Show properties
expires_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run will expire.

started_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was started.

cancelled_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was cancelled.

failed_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run failed.

completed_at
integer or null

The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run was completed.

incomplete_details
object or null

Details on why the run is incomplete. Will be null if the run is not incomplete.


Show properties
model
string

The model that the assistant used for this run.

instructions
string

The instructions that the assistant used for this run.

tools
array

The list of tools that the assistant used for this run.


Show possible types
metadata
map

Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

usage
object or null

Usage statistics related to the run. This value will be null if the run is not in a terminal state (i.e. in_progress, queued, etc.).


Show properties
temperature
number or null

The sampling temperature used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

top_p
number or null

The nucleus sampling value used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

The maximum number of prompt tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

truncation_strategy
object

Controls for how a thread will be truncated prior to the run. Use this to control the intial context window of the run.


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools before responding to the user. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "file_search"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
parallel_tool_calls
boolean

Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

response_format
string or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

}
Assistant stream eventsBeta
Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

Each event in a server-sent events stream has an event and data property:

event: thread.created
data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit thread.run.created when a new run is created, thread.run.completed when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a thread.message.created event, a thread.message.in_progress event, many thread.message.delta events, and finally a thread.message.completed event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully in your code. See the Assistants API quickstart to learn how to integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

CompletionsLegacy
Given a prompt, the model will return one or more predicted completions along with the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position. Most developer should use our Chat Completions API to leverage our best and newest models.

Create completionLegacy
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/completions
Creates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.

Request body
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.

prompt
string or array

Required
The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.

best_of
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n.

Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.

echo
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

frequency_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

See more information about frequency and presence penalties.

logit_bias
map

Optional
Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

logprobs
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.

The maximum value for logprobs is 5.

max_tokens
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 16
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion.

The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Example Python code for counting tokens.

n
integer or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
How many completions to generate for each prompt.

Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.

presence_penalty
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

See more information about frequency and presence penalties.

seed
integer or null

Optional
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result.

Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

stop
string / array / null

Optional
Defaults to null
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
Defaults to false
Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Example Python code.

stream_options
object or null

Optional
Defaults to null
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.


Show properties
suffix
string or null

Optional
Defaults to null
The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

This parameter is only supported for gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

user
string

Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

Returns
Returns a completion object, or a sequence of completion objects if the request is streamed.

Assistants (v1)Legacy
Build assistants that can call models and use tools to perform tasks.

Get started with the Assistants API

Create assistant (v1)Legacy
POST
 
https://api.openai.com/v1/assistants
Create an assistant with a model and instructions.

Request body
model
string

Required
ID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them. type: string

name
string or null

Optional
The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters.

description
string or null

Optional
The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters.

instructions
string or null

Optional
The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters.

tools
array

Optional
Defaults to []
A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types code_interpreter, retrieval, or function.


Show possible types
file_ids
array

Optional
Defaults to []
A list of file IDs attached to this assistant. There can be a maximum of 20 files attached to the assistant. Files are ordered by their creation date in ascending order.

metadata
map

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

Returns
An assistant object.

Path parameters
thread_id
string

Required
The ID of the thread to run.

Request body
assistant_id
string

Required
The ID of the assistant to use to execute this run.

model
string

Optional
The ID of the Model to be used to execute this run. If a value is provided here, it will override the model associated with the assistant. If not, the model associated with the assistant will be used.

instructions
string or null

Optional
Overrides the instructions of the assistant. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.

additional_instructions
string or null

Optional
Appends additional instructions at the end of the instructions for the run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis without overriding other instructions.

additional_messages
array or null

Optional
Adds additional messages to the thread before creating the run.


Show properties
tools
array or null

Optional
Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. This is useful for modifying the behavior on a per-run basis.


Show possible types
metadata

Optional
Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Keys can be a maximum of 64 characters long and values can be a maxium of 512 characters long.

temperature
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

top_p
number or null

Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

stream
boolean or null

Optional
If true, returns a stream of events that happen during the Run as server-sent events, terminating when the Run enters a terminal state with a data: [DONE] message.

max_prompt_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of prompt tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of prompt tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of prompt tokens specified, the run will end with status complete. See incomplete_details for more info.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null

Optional
The maximum number of completion tokens that may be used over the course of the run. The run will make a best effort to use only the number of completion tokens specified, across multiple turns of the run. If the run exceeds the number of completion tokens specified, the run will end with status complete. See incomplete_details for more info.

truncation_strategy
object

Optional

Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "TOOL_TYPE"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
response_format
string or object

Optional
Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

integer or null

The maximum number of completion tokens specified to have been used over the course of the run.

truncation_strategy
object


Show properties
tool_choice
string or object

Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tools and instead generates a message. auto is the default value and means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool. Specifying a particular tool like {"type": "TOOL_TYPE"} or {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.


Show possible types
response_format
string or object

Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason="length", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit thread.run.created when a new run is created, thread.run.completed when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses to create a message during a run, we emit a thread.message.created event, a thread.message.in_progress event, many thread.message.delta events, and finally a thread.message.completed event.

We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully in your code. See the Assistants API quickstart to learn how to integrate the Assistants API with streaming.
